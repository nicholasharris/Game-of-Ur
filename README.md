# Game-of-Ur
A javascript/browser implementation of an ancient Sumerian game called the Royal Game of Ur. You can use the files here to play the game in your browser. Currently two people can play each other in the page; I am currently developing a computer opponent as well that will soon be incorporated.

A great description of the game (including the rules) can be found in this video from The British Museum: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZskjLq040I . It is the oldest board game for which we know the original rules by which it was played. It is a kind of racing game that combines elements of skill and chance. 

TO RUN: just open the index.html file to run the game in your browser. Tested in Firefox.
